Hello Programming World!

My name is Dexter, an electrical engineer. Although I am one, I am more inclined with computers. I am shifting my career into software engineering. I would like to learn essential skills for this career but there are so many topics. I started learning Python. Do you have any suggestions for my next steps?

UPDATE 2023-09-10
I am now an iOS Developer!
- Before I become one, I originally studied web development, the MERN stack. I studied them online.
- On my first company, I was hired as web developer, frontend only.
- With great luck, they opened iOS Development role internally
- They are accepting people with zero knowledge on iOS Development
- With another great luck, almost no one wants to grab it
- I hesitated for two weeks, almost severing this great opportunity
- Good thing there are still slots available, around two slots I guess?
- It was good to have good people in this field'
- I am very thankful to my menter Rockerol!
- He is very patient!
- He never get angry even if things gets bad because of my mistake
- I am very thankful
- However, I need to advance so I moved to another company
- Now, I am walking this iOS developer career for more than a year
- Currently my 14th month, well exactly 13th month because I started as web developer for a month before
- I started writing about iOS development in medium, dev.to, and dubdub.space
- I read swift.org documentation such as initialization, concurrency, error handling, etc.
- I read some books such as:
    - Pro Multithreading and Memory Management for iOS and OS X_ with ARC, Grand Central Dispatch, and Blocks
    - Swift Apprentice - Beginning Programming with Swift
- Seeing the quantity of books I have read, I am a bit disappointed
- I will try to read more books!
- I want to target two books before ending this year!
- The next one I will read is UIKit Apprentice
- Then SwiftUI Apprentice
- Oh, I am also taking 100 Days of SwiftUI from hackingwithswift.com
- I travel a total of around 6 hours a day and work 8 hours a day
- That's 14 hours!
- If I add 1 hour preparation to go out, and 1 hour to 2 hours after going home, that would be 16 hours!
- I am in need more space and time, so I can relax a bit :)
